\Abstract{
  This short article illustrates how to write a manuscript for the
  \emph{Journal of Statistical Software} (JSS) using its {\LaTeX} style files.
  Generally, we ask to follow JSS's style guide and FAQs precisely. Also,
  it is recommended to keep the {\LaTeX} code as simple as possible,
  i.e., avoid inclusion of packages/commands that are not necessary.
  For outlining the typical structure of a JSS article some brief text snippets
  are employed that have been inspired by,
  discussing count data regression in \proglang{R}. Editorial comments and
  instructions are marked by vertical bars.
